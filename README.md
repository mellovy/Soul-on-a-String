## Development Log

### Week 1 — Godot & Git Setup

**Goal:** Install tools, set up version control, and get a "Hello World" 2D scene running.

**What was done:**
- Installed Godot (Standard build) and created the `Soul-on-a-String` project.
- Added a `Node2D` root with a `Sprite2D` placeholder and confirmed the scene runs (F5) with no errors.
- Created a private GitHub repository: [`mellovy/Soul-on-a-String`](https://github.com/mellovy/Soul-on-a-String).
- Initialized Git (`git init`) and added a Godot-specific `.gitignore` (ignoring `.godot/` and export folders).
- Enabled Git LFS and tracked large binary formats: `*.png`, `*.wav`, `*.jpg`, `*.ogg`, `*.mp3`, `*.ttf`.
- Committed and pushed the initial project setup.

Week 2 — Gameplay Mechanics & Game Feel

Goal: Build the core player-controlled mechanic and add a "game feel" / juice element.

Core mechanic: The player walks around the scene using CharacterBody2D, and colliding with an NPC (Area2D) triggers the start of a conversation — the foundation for the game's dialogue/relationship system.

What was done:

Set up custom Input Map actions: move_left, move_right, move_forward, move_back.
Created a Player scene (CharacterBody2D + Sprite2D + CollisionShape2D) with a script reading input and moving the body via move_and_slide().
Created an NPC scene (Area2D + Sprite2D + CollisionShape2D) that detects when the player enters its area and triggers a conversation-start event.
Added a squash-and-stretch juice effect on the player sprite while moving, easing back to normal scale when idle.
Playtested and adjusted movement speed and sprite scale for a readable top-down feel.
Committed and pushed a playable build.
